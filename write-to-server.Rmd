# Uploading vs Downloading?

+ Writing data _to_ REDCap is more difficult than reading data _from_ REDCap.
+ When you read, you receive data in the structure that the REDCap provides you.
+ You have some control about the columns, rows, and data types,
  but there is not a lot you have to specify to avoid errors.
+ In contrast, the structure of the dataset you send to the REDCap server must be precise.
+ You need to pass special variables so that the REDCap server understands the
  hierarchical structure of the data points.

If you are new to REDCap and its API,
please first understand the concepts described in these two REDCapR [vignettes](https://ouhscbbmc.github.io/REDCapR/articles/):

* [Typical REDCap Workflow for a Data Analyst](https://ouhscbbmc.github.io/REDCapR/articles/workflow-read.html) 
  (essentially everything in this workshop until now)
* [Retrieving Longitudinal and Repeating Structures](https://ouhscbbmc.github.io/REDCapR/articles/longitudinal-and-repeating.html)

# REDCapR

+ Uses the [httr](https://httr.r-lib.org/) (which uses curl) to interact with a REDCap server.
+ In a sense, REDCapR's goal is to directly translate data between REDCap's MariaDB and R's `data.frame`.  
+ Packages like [tidyREDCap](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyREDCap), [REDCapTidieR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=REDCapTidieR), & [REDCapDM](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=REDCapDM) take it a step further for facilitating important tasks.
+ Currently, there haven't been any second-level efficiencies developed for uploading, so we'll use REDCapR.
+ For a list of all the packages (not just R packages), see  [REDCap Tools](https://redcap-tools.github.io/projects/) (<https://redcap-tools.github.io/projects/>).
+ A part of this presentation requires the most recent version (that's not yet on CRAN): `remotes::install_github("OuhscBbmc/REDCapR")`

# Token Permission

+ Make sure the "API Import/Update" box is checked by the project admin.

+ Within REDCapR documentation, "import" means the client is uploading/writing to the server.  (Some packages define it differently.)
