What is REDCap (and why bother)?

---
# What's the big deal?

+ Based at Vanderbilt University and supported by the National Institutes of Health
+ Not open-source (the license specifies noncommercial research use only)
+ Continuous development since 2004
+ Supports researcher- and participant-facing data entry
+ Supports online and offline data collection

---
# By the Numbers
+ Free to consortium members (slightly limited by international export controls)
+ Wildly popular  
  + 6,000+ institutions in more than 150 countries
  + Acknowledged in more than 23,000 articles

.center[![:scale 60%](images/01_introduction/map.jpg)]

# Technology and Legal

+ Tech 
    + Written in PHP
    + Database is MySQL or Maria DB
    + Authentication includes LDAP, Shibboleth, OpenID, Google OAuth2 and more
    + Solid API support
+ Legal
    + REDCap is 21 CFR Part 11-ready
    + Built-in logging and audit trails
    + Designed to support *safe harbor* deidentification
    
---
# How do I access it?

+ Most academic medical centers have it.
+ Check the partner list: https://projectredcap.org/partners/.
+ We will use the demo instance at Vanderbilt: https://redcapdemo.vanderbilt.edu/.
    + Normally, you will use point-and-click tools.
    + Today, we will show you things and you will have read-only access to some data.

Workflows

---
# Steps

1. Create a project
2. Add/create a data entry form/instrument
3. Collect/enter data
4. View/summarize in REDCap
5. Export for additional magic

---
# But wait... there's more!

+ Multi-site support with Data Access Groups
+ Built-in, multi-language support
+ Randomization
+ Longitudinal projects with study calendars and scheduling
+ Repeated instruments for assessing unplanned repeats
    - Describe each "stop by" clinic visit
    - Describe each adverse event
+ Public or private dashboards
+ Send emails/text
+ Extensible via *External Modules*
